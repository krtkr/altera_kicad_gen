# altera_kicad_gen
A few scripts used to generate KiCad's library altera symbols.

Current source tree contains two editions of the generator:
1. src/kicad
    first version made within a few days just to generate something
2. src/KicadSymGen
    an attempt to generate symbols with some code based on kicad source code
    itself
